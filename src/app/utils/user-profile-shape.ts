/**
 * Normalisers for the two shapes of Sunbird's user-read response.
 *
 * `/apis/proxies/v8/api/user/v2/read` does not return the same document on old Sunbird and
 * on Sunbird Spark, and the differences are silent -- fields are absent rather than empty,
 * so code reading them gets `undefined` instead of an error and the failure surfaces
 * somewhere unrelated. Both differences are handled here so call sites need not know.
 *
 * Verified against a live Spark environment (2026-08-25). The sibling apps carry the same
 * fix: Sphere/eagle-fusion commits ba3932dab and 5b0fae7da, and the creation portal's
 * `@ws-widget/utils` helper of the same name.
 *
 * The parameters are `unknown` rather than `any` because this is an unvalidated API
 * document: every field is narrowed before use, so a malformed response yields an empty
 * result instead of a thrown TypeError deep inside a caller.

 * `organisations[].roles`; Spark's V5 read does populate the top level, but with raw role
 * records rather than names.
 *
 * So: prefer the top-level array when it yields usable names, else flatten the
 * per-organisation lists. Roles are de-duplicated, because a user belonging to two
 * organisations commonly holds the same role in both.
